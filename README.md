## How to Use

### Edit the Resume

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashish-kus/latex-resume.git
   cd latex-resume
   ```

2. Open `resume.tex` in your favorite LaTeX editor (such as Overleaf, TeXstudio, or VSCode with LaTeX Workshop).

3. Modify the contents (name, experience, education, etc.).

### Compile the Resume

If you have LaTeX installed locally:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```

This will generate a `resume.pdf` file in the same directory.

### Online Editing (Optional)

You can also edit and compile your resume online using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/):

1. Create a new project.
2. Upload `resume.tex` and any other required files.
3. Edit and download the compiled PDF.
